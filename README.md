# Student Capturing System

This JavaFX project is one of my assignments from university. The aim was to create a GUI application based on the idea of a student capturing system. A student can be added onto the system by entering their studentID, year of study and 3 module allocations. A student's allocation of modules can also be added and a student can also be removed from the system.
